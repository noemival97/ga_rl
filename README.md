# Genetic algorithms for reinforcement learning problem
The purpose of the project is to analyse the differences between classical reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation approaches, developing an agent capable of solving a Cartpole problem. Three different types of algorithms are considered: two classical reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and Advantage Actor Critic, and a genetic algorithm.
The project tries to reproduce "Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning"(https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567) in a simpler environment
